# Introduction

**NOTE:** This guide is meant to improve your skills, NOT to test your knowledge. Feel free to search or ask anyone in the Mechanical subteam for any information. 

This guide simulates the environments you will work in with this team. All tasks will be hands-on with minimal instructions (some hints). The goal is to give you proficiency in CAD, not mastery. Mastery will come with continued experience and dedication in engineering.

## Account Creation & Recommended Settings

### Step 1:
Use your Education Email to create an Onshape Account. If you have any questions, feel free to ask us.

### Step 2:
Select the dropdown on the top right of the screen next to your name. Choose “My Account,” go to the preferences section, and then the units heading.

Please enter the following units of measurement, which are both our team’s and Australia’s standards:

*Note:* These will be the default units when no unit is specified and will be displayed with the dimension tool. Onshape can easily convert between units of measurement, which is useful for dealing with imperial measurements. Simply type the magnitude followed by the unit symbol, e.g., “in” for inches, “cm” for centimeters, or “rad” for radians. This will streamline your workflow.

## Basic CAD

**NOTE:** This section is designed to teach basic CAD usage and skills, not necessarily good CAD habits. We will cover good CAD practices in our solution presentation.

### Task 1: Battery
Model a dimension-accurate battery used on the robot, using calipers in the workshop and their website.

### Task 2: Tubes

#### 2.1 – Drivebase Frame
Design half of a drivebase frame with M5 clearance holes 12.5mm apart on a RHS tube. Use your decision-making skills and the 2024 rules to decide on suitable dimensions.

*Hint:* Use shortcuts to speed up the process (do not individually sketch and extrude 100s of holes).

#### 2.2 – Standardised L Gusset
Design a simple L gusset to connect the drivebase tubes. Ensure to fillet the corners, as CNC machines cannot handle sharp corners.

#### 2.3 – Drivebase Assembly
Using the assembly tab, connect the L gussets to the tubes so they are fastened at the corners.

*Hint:* Consider how the components would be connected in real life.

### Task 3: Swerve Drivebase

#### 3.1 – Introduction to Mkcad
Download the MkCAD library into Onshape. If you have questions, ask us. We will review its functionality when we return to school. Import one SDS MK4i Swerve Module into the assembly with two NEOs, below the frame with a size of 10-32, and an SDS Billet wheel. We use CANcoders to control the wheels. We will cover the swerve modules' function in the next session.

#### 3.2 – Drivebase Tubes
Using the formula:
## Tube Length = Drivebase Length - 214.6 (Size of the swerve modules)
Design a 4-sided, square drivebase to mount the swerve modules at each corner. Refer to the real robot or online resources. For this tutorial, refer to R104 in the 2022 FIRST® Robotics Competition Game Manual for the maximum frame perimeter.

*Hint:* Use the circular pattern tool to save time and reduce effort!

#### 3.3 – Bumpers
Design a bumper for the drivebase, considering the drivebase and tube context. Refer to rules R401 and beyond for bumper restrictions for Rapid React. We use 63.5 mm diameter pool noodles stacked upon one another, tied to 127 mm tall by 19.05 mm wide radiata pine wood, covered with cloth.

*Hint:* Use the sweep tool to extrude along a line, rather than extruding 4 different sides of the bumper.

### Task 4: Extension Battery Holder

Design a battery holder for the battery created in Task 1. The holder must:
- Firmly hold the battery
- Allow quick removal and replacement of the battery
- Attach to the drivebase you have already designed
- Utilize available materials

You are encouraged to review designs from other teams, but be aware that many teams use unconventional mounting locations or materials and processes that may not be available to us.

*Note:* Mentors will ask questions about your design choices, so consider them carefully. We do not expect perfection, so do not get overly focused on any single step.
